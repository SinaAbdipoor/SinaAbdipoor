- 👋 Hi, I’m @SinaAbdipoor
- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, hybrid evolutionary methods in scheduling; metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics in optimization; and hyperparameter tuning of machine learning methods.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a state-of-the-art optimization technique to achieve a more general AI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on optimization, metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics, and hybrid evolutionary machine learning methods.
